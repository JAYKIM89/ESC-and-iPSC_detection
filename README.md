# Analysis of the morphological differences of mESCs and miPSCs using Deep learning 

#### A convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm can distinguishes the ESCs and iPSCs lines cultured in the different cell culture conditions.
#### This code provides information that CNN can analyze the difference in cell shapes according to the culture medium conditions with high accuracy.
